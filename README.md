Hi, I am Dade Butler

This is a GitHub repository for me to remember lessons I've recieved on CodeAcademy. Particularly CSS Properties and how they work.
Ya hombre forgets sometimes, so having an entire repository to use as a baseline is extremely helpful.

As stuff gets added to this repository, so too will I update this README. Although, that could be the famous last words of a programmer.
