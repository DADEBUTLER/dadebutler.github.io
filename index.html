          <p>Welcome to my Cheatsheet Recipe site. This website was created in order to help me to remember a plethora of CSS Properties that can help me create other websites. It also helps me remember my Chili Recipe.</p>

          <p>As you can see above, our dancing ice cream is in the shape of a circle. This is because of the use of the border-radius property. This along with other basic properties within CSS are the basic skeleton of a website. </p>

            <p class='left'>You see, CSS Properties like display: grid:, grid-template-columns:, grid-area:, and even the padding property. Are extraordinarily important to understand; in order to know how to position elements exactly where you want. This basic knowledge can empower you to create simple yet aesthetically pleasing websites. <span>For example, right now you are looking at a grid that employs all of those properties and more.</span</p>
            <p class='left'><strong>It doesn't stop there though.</strong> Even the something as easy to forget as the <em>"Strong"</em> and <em>"EM"</em> tags in html; can make reading your site not only easier for you and your users. But for Search Engine AI's crawling your site. Helping your site rise in the search engine rankings.</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong id='step-start'>Cutting the produce,</strong> start by cutting the Red Onion into dice. Next, thinly slice the 4 Cloves of Garlic. Finally, halve and thinly slice the Poblano Pepper and Yellow Chili</li>
            <li><strong id='step-start'>Making the Garlic Chips.</strong> In a small pan, heat place an oil of your choosing to Medium heat. Once hot, place your garlic directly into the oil. Cook the Garlic until the slices are browned and crispy. Once done, remove them from the pan and place the Garlic Chips onto a plate with a paper towel.</li>
            <li><strong id='step-start'>Cook the produce,</strong> in a large pot or Dutch Oven, coat the bottom of your vessel in a neutral oil. Heat the oil to Medium heat and place in your Diced Red Onions. Sweat the onions then add your thinly sliced Yellow Chili and Poblano Pepper. Cook until vibrant in color</li>
            <li><strong id='step-start'>Add the Ground Hot Sausage</strong> to the pot and cook until browned. Stirring frequently.</li>
            <li><strong id='step-start'>Mix the spices in</strong> a measuring cup or vessel of your choosing. Add 1 ½ Tablespoons of Cumin, 1 Tablespoon Smoke Paprika,  ½ Tablespoons of Garlic Powder, ½ Tablespoons Onion Powder, and ½ Teaspoon Hickory Smoked Garlic Powder. Optional, Red Pepper flakes up to an amount of your choosing.</li>
            <li><strong id='step-start'>Add the BBQ Sauce to the pot,</strong> simmer for roughly 5 minutes or until viscous. Stir frequently to prevent sticking to the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li><strong id='step-start'>Add the Beans to the pot,</strong> do not strain the beans of their juices, after adding your beans let sit for 2 and a half minutes then add all of your spices.

      <section>
        <div class='tip-jar'>
          <h4>Tips</h4>
          <p>The first tip while making this chili is in how you choose to cut the onions. If you can’t dice an onion with a knife, just shredding it will work fine. Make sure the grater has a large enough cut to it though. Too fine a shred and you’ll end up with onion paste, which can also work. But you won’t taste the red onion the same. Just be prepared to cry, alot. You can deep fry both of the peppers should you want. This will keep some of the spice out of the chili and you get some sweet chips to top the chili of those who want the extra spice. I personally also prefer to use smoked black peppers and himalayan pink salt for this recipe. The extra layer of smoke, no matter the kind, gives the chili a much greater depth when combined with the bite of the pepper itself. <span>The final tip I have is when you are adding the BBQ sauce to your pot or dutch oven. Keep that sauce moving. A majority of the sauces you’ll choose will have sugar content of some kind. This causes it to burn quickly if you put it into a hot pot. You don’t want to deal with that kind of mess. Trust me.</span></p>

        <h4>CSS Tips</h4>
          <p>CSS’s grid-area: property doesn’t need you to contain the value you give it in quotation marks. This cost me so much time, and caused me so much frustration. You must assign the areas themselves within quotation marks in the grid-template-area: property. But the grid-area: property does not need it. The line-height property is how you adjust the line spacing of your text. This confuses me as it’s called line spacing in conversation, yet they named the property line-height. Don’t worry though. They got letter spacing right, and they named the property for it letter-spacing.</p>
