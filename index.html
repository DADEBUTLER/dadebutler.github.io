      <p>Welcome to my Cheatsheet Recipe site. This website was created in order to help me to remember a plethora of CSS Properties that can help me create other websites. It also helps me remember my Chili Recipe.</p>

      <p>As you can see above, our dancing ice cream is in the shape of a circle. This is because of the use of the border-radius property. This along with other basic properties within CSS are the basic skeleton of a website. </p>

        <h3 class='left'>Another Thing</h3>
        <p class='left'>You see, CSS Properties like display: grid:, grid-template-columns:, grid-area:, and even the padding property. Are extraordinarily important to understand; in order to know how to position elements exactly where you want. This basic knowledge can empower you to create simple yet aesthetically pleasing websites.

          For example, right now you are looking at a grid that employs all of those properties and more.</p>

    <h4>Tips</h4>
    <p>The first tip while making this chili is in how you choose to cut the onions. If you can’t dice an onion with a knife, just shredding it will work fine. Make sure the grater has a large enough cut to it though. Too fine a shred and you’ll end up with onion paste, which can also work. But you won’t taste the red onion the same. Just be prepared to cry, alot. You can deep fry both of the peppers should you want. This will keep some of the spice out of the chili and you get some sweet chips to top the chili of those who want the extra spice. I personally also prefer to use smoked black peppers and himalayan pink salt for this recipe. The extra layer of smoke, no matter the kind, gives the chili a much greater depth when combined with the bite of the pepper itself.

The final tip I have is when you are adding the BBQ sauce to your pot or dutch oven. Keep that sauce moving. A majority of the sauces you’ll choose will have sugar content of some kind. This causes it to burn quickly if you put it into a hot pot. You don’t want to deal with that kind of mess. Trust me.

    <h4>CSS Tips</h4>
    <p>CSS’s grid-area: property doesn’t need you to contain the value you give it in quotation marks. This cost me so much time, and caused me so much frustration. You must assign the areas themselves within quotation marks in the grid-template-area: property. But the grid-area: property does not need it. The line-height property is how you adjust the line spacing of your text. This confuses me as it’s called line spacing in conversation, yet they named the property line-height. Don’t worry though. They got letter spacing right, and they named the property for it letter-spacing.</p>
